● Problem Solving:
● It is the process of identifying a goal, analyzing 
the current situation, and taking steps to bridge 
the gap between the two by finding an effective 
solution.
Problem Solving is the ability of an intelligent 
agent to find a sequence of actions to achieve a 
goal.● In AI, problem solving involves 
● designing algorithms or systems:
● That can think logically, evaluate options, and 
make decisions to achieve a specific goal.
● For example: Planning a trip, solving a puzzle, 
or finding the shortest path to a destination are 
all problem-solving tasks.● Example: Planning a Family Trip
● Imagine we want to plan a family trip to the 
beach. 
● Let's use the four aspects to analyze the 
problem:● 1. What is the explicit goal of the problem?
● This is the clear and specific objective we are 
trying to achieve.
● For our example:
● The goal is to reach the beach and enjoy a 
relaxing day with family.2. What is the implicit criteria for success?
● These are the hidden or secondary goals that 
ensure the solution is successful.
● For our example:
● Everyone in the family should have a good 
time.
●     Reach the beach safely and on time.
●     Minimize expenses and avoid stress.3. What is the initial situation?
● This is the starting point or the current state of 
the problem.
● For our example:
● You and your family are at home.
● You have a car but need to decide on the route, 
budget, and items to pack.4. Ability to perform
● This involves the resources, actions, and 
strategies available to achieve the goal.
● For our example:
● Resources: A car, money for fuel, and food.
● Actions: Driving to the beach, packing 
essentials, planning activities.
● Strategies: Using GPS for the shortest route, 
checking the weather forecast, and making a 
list of items to carry.How This Relates to AI
● In AI, solving problems is similar:
●  Explicit goals: Represented as the desired 
outcome in a problem space.
●     Implicit criteria: AI algorithms consider 
constraints like cost, time, or optimization.
●     Initial state: The starting point of the system 
(input data or environment).
●     Ability to perform: The actions or operations 
AI can take, such as searching, planning, or 
learning.● AI uses 
● search algorithms, 
● heuristics, 
● and decision-making techniques to solve 
problems in ways similar to how we plan a trip.Introduction
● The 8 Queens Problem is a classic AI problem: 
Place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two 
queens attack each other. This means:
● No two queens can share the same row, 
column, or diagonal.
● AI uses problem formulation to represent and 
solve this.● There are two types of formulations: 
● 1.Incremental formulations:
● 2.Complete State formulations.
